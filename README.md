# The problem BabyShop solves :smiley:
This web-application solves the problem of baby items that are missing from babies lives. Here are donations and renting ads that are trying to resolve your necessary object for baby in a very cheap budget. Also the problem of babysitting is resolved here. And our web-application is trying to solve the problem of abortions as a lot of mothers decide to kill their baby because they can't afford new things for them. Another thing this web-application is trying to solve is the educaation and the happines of children. Every children have the right to be happy and to have a good education, health, and to enjoy their childhood along with toys because the childhood is the most beautiful period of your life. We consider this app a very important source of happiness and of hope for life for them.

# Challenges we ran into :slightly_smiling_face:
The main problem I think was the time. As we are not using Bootstrap, all the coding in HTML and CSS we have to manage by ourselves, which was very time consuming Another major problem was the backend. Just 2 of our members knows backend and for them, it was kinda difficult to finish by themselves the webapp, but in my case it also took a lot of time to design the templates and adding content to them. As our backend was not complete, in the last moment we have to record the video which was at 4.00 AM Indian Time. :sweat_smile:
